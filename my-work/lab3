Once upon a time, there was a delicious pizza that everyone loved.
Every weekend, people gathered to watch football games.
After enjoying the food while watching the games, they would go to sleep.
In order to stay fit, they made sure to run every morning and evening.
One day as they were spending time together, the pizza was left out and became cold.
But one person's brave dog didn't mind; he loved the taste despite its coldness.
The friends went to see a two-hour movie yesterday, and they found it to be enjoyable and inspiring.
And then after all the excitement, they had to do their homework weekly to keep up with their studies.
